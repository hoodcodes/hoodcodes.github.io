### Your First 2 Weeks

Question: What is a comprehensive list of things I can do in the first 2 weeks at a new job to help get up to speed and productive as quickly as possible, and thus make a solid first impression?

My initial list is as follows:

- Run VS Maintainability Index tests on all code to get some sense of how ‘healthy’ the code is.
- Review all documentation that is available
- If diagrams of workflows / processes do not exist, draw some up as an exercise to confirm your understanding of them - and have them peer reviewed by the architect or other senior engineer.
- Consume all available general documentation about company products and services to get acclimated to business domain, challenges and opportunities and to assist with context to what exists as code.
- Get comfortable with the CI/CD process.
- Review existing unit tests.
