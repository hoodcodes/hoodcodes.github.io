### Coding Playgrounds

Online code editors when you want to try something out quickly, demonstrate some code, or look at someone else's code.

Most of these are geared towards front end languages, however there are some server side options.

[Comparing Code Playgrounds](https://codysaylor.com/notes/comparing-codepen-jsfiddle-cssdeck-liveweave-jsbin-dabblet/) - updated in 2021. Cody Saylor provides a good look into the more popular playgrounds.

[Linqpad - .Net Playground app](https://www.linqpad.net/) - This is actually a small (20mb) downloadable app. I had it for years and it came in handy for writing LINQ code that hit sql dbs, but it is useful for C# and F# as well. The Standard Edition is free. It is actively maintained and updated with the latest .Net version. I am contemplating upgrading as it might assist with my review of ALL C# features from Beta until the present.
