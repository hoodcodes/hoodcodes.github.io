### Coding Playgrounds

Online code editors when you want to try something out quickly, demonstrate some code, or look at someone else's code.

Most of these are geared towards front end languages, however there are some server side options.

[Comparing Code Playgrounds](https://codysaylor.com/notes/comparing-codepen-jsfiddle-cssdeck-liveweave-jsbin-dabblet/) - updated in 2021. Cody Saylor provides a good look into the more popular playgrounds.

[Linqpad - .Net Playground app](https://www.linqpad.net/) - For Windows OS only (unfortunately). This is actually a small (20mb) downloadable app. I had it for years and it came in handy for writing LINQ code that hit sql dbs, but it is useful for C# and F# as well. The Standard Edition is free. It is actively maintained and updated with the latest .Net version. They allow you to activate your license on up to 3 machines (work, home, laptop).

[Go Online Dev Playground](https://go.dev/play/)

[Replit.com](https://replit.com/) - Over 50 languages supported. However C# for example, uses the mono compiler, and no information is available exactly on what version of C# is supported.

Overall, for my practice, sticking to microprojects using VS Code makes more sense. I can see benefit for front end playgrounds to showcase something or for coding challenges.

Also now, there is VS Code online: [vscode.dev(https://vscode.dev/)
