### The DOM

DOM - Document Object Model. It is a tree of nodes or elements by the browser

the DOM is object oriented - meaning each node has its own properties.

We can read / write / manipulate to the DOM

JQuery was used to do this for a long time but we can do this more easily with vanilla JS now

**How it is organized:**

- Window object
  - Document object
    - html object (the root element)
      - head object
        - elements (e.g. title, metatags)
      - body object
        - elements (e.g. h1, a)
          - text node
          - attributes (e.g. href on an a element)
