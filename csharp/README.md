### Summary Description

- [Version 2 (.Net Framework 2.0)](version2.md)
- [Version 3 (.Net Framework 3.0/3.5)](version3.md)
- [Version 4 (.Net Framework 4)](version4.md)

### The .Net Framework Evolution

- .NET Framework
- .NET Core
- .NET Standard
- .NET

### Using `dotnet new` custom templates

At the CLI, run the following to see the list of custom templates available with the `dotnet new` command:

```sh
dotnet new --list
```

Interesting side note: You can create your own templates as well.

#### Reference Links for dotnet custom templates

- [.Net Default Templates](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-new-sdk-templates)
- [Custom Templates for dotnet new](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/custom-templates)
- [Create a WedApi with dotnet custom template](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/creating-asp-net-core-web-api-project-using-net-core-cli/)

You can create practically any type of project using the default templates for .Net.

### Creating a WebApi in C# Steps

1. run `dotnet new webapi <projectName>`
2. run `cd <projectName>`
3. Add a gitignore by running `dotnet new gitignore`
4. run `dotnet build`
5. run `dotnet run`
6. In a browser, navigate to the URL suggested and append `/swagger` to the end. Example:
   1. ` https://localhost:7212/swagger`
   2. Click `Try it out` button. Then copy the `Request URL` and paste it into Postman on a new GET request and click `Send`.
   3. You should receive a `200` Response with JSON data in the Body

run `Ctrl+C` in the Terminal to shut down the webapi.

- Difference between WCF vs Web API
  - **WCF**
    - uses XML
    - enables use of other protocols for higher performant processes (named pipes, TCP, UDP).
    - one way messaging, msg queues, duplex communications
  - **Web API**
    - uses HTTP
    - provides all HTTP features (request/response headers, caching, versioning, content formats, URIâ€™s)
    - great for providing services to broad range of clients - mobile, tablet, browsers,
- Using Directive vs using() statement: <TODO>
- Boxing vs UnBoxing: <TODO>
- Yield - 2 forms of use:
  - `yield return` - used to return the current iteration of a foreach statement or linq query. the position is retained for the next time the iterator function is called.
  - `yield break` - used to end the iteration. like when there are no more values in an enumeration.
- Structs
  - structs are value types. they cannot be inherited from for that reason, as all value types are sealed.
  - structs can implement interfaces.
- Interfaces
  - Interfaces contain methods, properties, events, indexers. Members are automatically public and can NOT contain access modifiers. Members can NOT be static.
  - They do NOT contain: constants, fields, operators, instance constructors, finalizers or types.
  - When a class implements an interface, the class or struct must implement all members.

### Popular .Net Interfaces

- ISerialize
- IDisposable - for resources requiring cleanup, used with using
- IEnumerable<T> and IEnumerable - for use with foreach and LINQ
- IComparable<T> and ICompare<T> - for generalized sorting
- IEquatable<T> and IEqualityComparer<T> - for generalized equality
- ICollection IList<T> - mutable collections
- IDictionary<T,K> - lookup collections
- IQueryable<T> - lets you execute requests against queriable data sources

### Common Collection Types and FYIs

All collections are based on the ICollection Interface.

IList

- Array
- ArrayList
- List<T>

ICollection

- Queue
- ConcurrentQueue<T>
- Stack
- ConcurrentStack<T>
- LinkedList<T>

IDictionary

- HashTable
- SortedList
- Dictionary<Tkey, TValue>
- SortedList<Tkey, TValue>
- ConcurrentDictionary<TKey, TValue>
- KeyedCollection<TKey, TValue> - unique - behaves like a list and a dictionary because it is a list of values with keys embedded within the values.

Others -

- NameValueCollection
- OrderedDictionary
- StringCollection
- StringDictionary
- BitArray
- BitVector32
- HybridDictionary

### Types of Searches and the best Collections for them:

- First In, First Out - Queues
- Last In, First Out - Stacks
- Sorts - SortedList & SortedList<TKey, TValue> are sorted versions of the Hashtable and Dictionary<TKey, TValue)

Indexes of all Collections are zero-based, except Array - which allows arrays that are not zero-based.

### LINQ

[LINQ Reference](./linq.md)

### Abstract and Virtual Classes

- [C# Corner: Abstract Class & Interface: Two Villains of Every Interview - Part 1](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/d0e913/abstract-class-interface-two-villains-of-every-interview/)
- [Abstract Class & Interface: Two Villains of Every Interview - Part 2](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/d0e913/abstract-class-interface-two-villains-of-every-interview756/)

Why do we want abstract Classes? To provide default functionality and to add abstract methods.

Abstract classes can NOT be instantiated. they have no implementation so their method definition is followed by a semicolon:

```csharp
public abstract class A
{
public abstract void DoWork(int i);
}
```

Derived classes must implement all abstract methods.

An abstract class can have non-abstract methods, and this aids in making code more DRY - less code duplication. And if these methods needed updating in the future, you would just update in one place on the abstract class.

Virtual: when an abstract class inherits a virtual method from a base class, the abstract class can override the virtual method with an abstract method. Virtual forces derived classes to provide new implementations for virtual methods.

Example of use of Virtual:

```csharp
// compile with: /target:library
public class D
{
    public virtual void DoWork(int i)
    {
        // Original implementation.
    }
}

public abstract class E : D
{
    public abstract override void DoWork(int i);
}

public class F : E
{
    public override void DoWork(int i)
    {
        // New implementation.
    }
}
```
