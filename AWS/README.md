### 2022 Goal: AWS Developer Associate Certification

AWS has issued a challenge to pursue a certification, and to complete all learning path courses, which are free, by June 1st, 2022. As a reward, I will be given a free full practice exam as part of my preparation for taking the real exam. This is good timing and motivation as it aligns with my goals to get that certification in 2022.

I am looking to chronicle my experience pursuing this goal, and my experiences with the AWS Skill Builder resources.
