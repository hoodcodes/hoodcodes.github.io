# AWS Developer Certification Blog

Chronicaling my journey to getting my AWS Developer Cloud Associate certification here in 2022.

These are rough notes which I may use to help create a polished Article series on the topic once I am done.

**March 24, 2022**

I decided to share this goal with my FTE company manager as a personal goal for myself which could be beneficial for my overall performance rating at the end of the year. Doing so means I needed to put together some details for sharing this in my work goal planner. This did not take much time. An interesting item is that I have been told that my department is focused on trying to find a good way to get developers up to speed on AWS since this is the primary cloud platform being utilized. So, I have a task to share my knowledge on what I am doing with someone. Who knows, maybe it might be helpful for more than just myself to become a SME on AWS for my department.

**March 17, 2022**

I signed up to AWS's Certification Challenge this month, from an email invitation I received.

I have previously completed Azure training (did not pursue the certification exam however) back in 2021, when Microsoft had the superior free training available out of the big 3 cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud). I am glad to see that AWS has stepped up with their free training offerings as well, and I am hopeful the experience will be similar. I will be able to provide some insight on how Azure and AWS training compares, although to be fair to Microsoft I might want to re-visit their training as they may have made updates as well.

The incentive for the AWS challenge is that if I complete 30.5 hours of structured training by June 1st, then I am eligible for a free practice exam to help prepare for the real deal. 30.5 hours is a lot - it is a commitment to really learn the content so you have internalized it. It is doable and needs to be intentionally planned for that sake, given my schedule and other commitments. But beyond that - hey, challenge on!

Let me detail how this started. First, I received the email invitation. I would suspect that started based on my creating an AWS account and specifying something that indicated I was a software engineer.

**Anyway, this is what i received by email:**

**Next, after registering for the Associate Challenge, I received this:**

**And this resulted in my getting access to the AWS Skill Builder Portal:**

And since AWS is apparently very interested in keeping you engaged in the challenge and your journey to certification, they have an active pipeline of information they will feed you via email once they know you are interested or signed up. Today I received a notice on a 2.5 hour seminar around the topic of the exam itself. I plan to register and at least record it, but hopefully attend it as well, depending on my day job commitments.

**Here is what they sent today:**

To wrap up my first entry on this journey, I'll say I am excited and looking forward to gaining my certification in 2022. Who knows, this might lead to more AWS or even other cloud certifications. This first cert will be a milestone for sure.
