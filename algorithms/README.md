### Overview

Merge Sort: referred to as a 'divide and conquer algorithm'

1.  Divide the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing 1 element (a list of 1 element is considered sorted).
2.  Repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only 1 sublist remaining. This will be the sorted list.

Insertion Sort:

1.  Insertion sort iterates, consuming one input element each repetition, and growing a sorted output list. At each iteration, insertion sort removes one element from the input data, finds the location it belongs within the sorted list, and inserts it there. It repeats until no input elements remain.
2.  It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort. However, insertion sort provides several advantages: Good for smaller number of elements (8 to 20).

Quick Sort:

1.  Quick Sort (sometimes called partition-exchange sort) is an efficient sorting algorithm, serving as a systematic method for placing the elements of an array in order. Developed by Tony Hoare in 1959[1] and published in 1961,[2] it is still a commonly used algorithm for sorting. When implemented well, it can be about two or three times faster than its main competitors, merge sort and heapsort
2.  The algorithm starts by choosing a pivot value. It proceeds by partitioning the elements. Elements larger than the pivot are partitioned on the right side of the pivot and element smaller than the pivot are partitioned on the left side of the pivot. It then recursively applies the algorithm on the partitions.
