There are 2 sets of shell script syntax:

- Bourne - more widely used, and much more flexible
- C - more comfortable for C programmers because it is similar to their language syntax

For the Bourne syntax, there are different dialects available:

- sh
- bash (extension of sh. Bourne Again SHell. )
- zsh
- ksh

If you stay away from the shell-specific features, your code is portable.

### Writing your first bash script

You will need to set your file with the correct permissions prior to running it. For the example hello.sh script, I ran the following:

```Bash
chmod u+x ./hello.sh
```

Then, being in the same directory in the terminal, I could run the command to execute the script:

```Bash
./hello.sh
```
