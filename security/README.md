### Coding Notes

The most common techniques that hackers use to break-into an application are (a) SQL Injection, (b) Hidden Field Tampering, and (c) Cross-site Scripting.

We should probably not be using hidden fields because of security risks.

For that matter - not exposing entity models directly to the view is also recommended.
