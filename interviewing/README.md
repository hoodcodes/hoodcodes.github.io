# Interviewing Reference

These are questions I am interested in asking myself, let alone anyone else.

### Questions of Interest to me

- I would be interested in hearing you talk about the project you mentioned working on at Company X
  - maybe - describe at a high level the problem you were solving
  - also - what did you find challenging
  - and - what did you enjoy the most about the project
- If you mentioned SOLID in your resume, explain one or two of your favorite principles and why you appreciate them.
- Would you have any short or long-term goals you would like to share?
- What would you say you enjoy most? Front end, back end, everything? - and why?
- Tell me about your unit testing experience.
  - what do you like to test for when you approach unit testing a component?
- When you get stuck on a problem - how do you get unstuck?
  - how long

1. What projects are you working on at home?
   Why to ask this: Great Developers are passionate about what they do. Talking about their professional work is fine, but that’s what they get paid to do whether they enjoy it or not. The best Developers, in my experience, always have their own side-projects. They needn’t be big or overly ambitious, and are an excellent way to hone their craft, try out new techniques and learn new skills. Side projects demonstrate enthusiasm and desire to learn, and if a Developer doesn’t have any, I want to know why.

2. What beta toys are you playing with?
   Why to ask this: This relates to the first question – technology constantly evolves with new products and versions released frequently. If you wait to learn a technology once it becomes mainstream, you are waiting too long and will eventually get left behind. For example, iOS 6 was released this September, but there was a Developer preview available from June. iOS Developers should have been playing with iOS 6’s preview to learn its new features and see how it affects their development.
   At the very least, if a Developer isn’t using the most up-to-date tools at work, he should be playing with them at home, or risk getting left behind. Playing with beta tools and latest technologies again shows that vital desire to learn, as knowledge becomes defunct rapidly in the tech world. At the same time, a tech recruiter should be aware of these trends and new techs in order to ask about them.

3. What source control do you use?
   Why to ask this: Source control is software that manages code during its build; logging what changes are made (and by whom) and saving previous versions so if a Developer breaks something badly, they roll back to a stable version. Source control isn’t essential to get a project done, but it’s universally agreed that anyone working in a team, jumping in and out of one another’s code, will benefit from using source control.
   Source control is even the subject of the first of 12 questions on the Joel Test; a well-known and oft-used test to determine a development team’s quality by asking yes/no questions on 12 development best practices – ideally a team should do at least 11 out of the 12 (see link for full list). Good use of source control shows the ability to work as a member of a team efficiently, and demonstrates an organised approach to coding.

4. How do you approach your documentation?
   Why to ask this: Documentation is essentially the Technical Guide to a project, explaining how to use it, providing technical specifications, guides to algorithms and APIs etc. Good documentation is key to successful projects; ask any developer and they will list hundreds of examples of spaghetti code they can’t make heads or tails of, with no documentation to explain what the heck is going on.
   Developers construct vast technical architecture in their heads and write hundreds of lines of code daily. They might remember what they wrote yesterday, but last month, or last year, and thousands of lines of code ago? Unlikely. Documentation isn’t fun or sexy, and is often ignored in favour of other more pressing concerns. However, when the excrement hits the rotating air circulation device, good documentation can save the day. A good Developer will create thorough documentation for his projects, and this shows a quality-focused approach to their work.

5. Give me an example of a project that completely failed?
   Why to ask this: I got this one from a client who gave notoriously tough interviews – all his questions concerned project failures and screw-ups. He reasoned that all your successes are listed on your CV, so you get a far better view of a person from what they leave off! This isn’t a variant of the “what is one of your weaknesses” questions, where you give an answer that is actually a veiled positive. Keep probing until you get a real disaster. How they responded will give you a far better idea of what they are like in the workplace, and what their key weaknesses are – which you can then help prep them on for an interview.
   Asking these questions helps identify passionate, driven and quality-focused developers who will be a boon to any client, although this is list is far from exhaustive. What questions do you ask to find the best talent, and how do they help?

Other Questions

1. "Describe the project you've worked on that you're most proud of. What did you do that worked out particularly well?”
   This tells me a lot about what they know, what they value, what actual positions they've held on a team, and whether they actually think about what they're doing.
2. “Describe the project you've worked on that you're least proud of. What would you do differently?”
   I need people who can learn, and learning means making mistakes, recognizing that, and doing a better job next time.
3. “If I have a Web application that I find is still running (via top/ps/whatever) but users are getting ‘connection refused’ when trying to access it, how would I go about diagnosing the problem?”
   With the answer to that question, I get to hear about the interviewee's thought process, favorite diagnostic tools, and biases, as well as whether they really know how to solve problems. Getting the “right” answer isn’t important, but it tells me about how the person thinks and how well they've familiarized themselves with the tools they use.
4. How would you approach getting up to speed on an existing project?
5. Have you been keeping up with the latest updates to anything? if so, what have you learned? Teach me one or two things you have learned.
6. What don’t you like about the language(s) you use and why ?

### Data Structures Topics

How do you find phone numbers in a 50,000 html pages? (look up grep and get regex familiarity to

Describe the meaning of these: Big O notation, and knowing that algorithms usually fall into the following performance classes: constant-time, logarithmic, linear, polynomial, exponential, and factorial.

Data Structures - describe each of these:
The (concrete) data structures they absolutely must understand are these:

- arrays - I'm talking about C-language and Java-language arrays: fixed-sized, indexed, contiguous structures whose elements are all of the same type, and whose elements can be accessed in constant time given their indices.
- vectors - also known as "growable arrays" or ArrayLists. Need to know that they're objects that are backed by a fixed-size array, and that they resize themselves as necessary.
- linked lists - lists made of nodes that contain a data item and a pointer/reference to the next (and possibly previous) node.
- hashtables - amortized constant-time access data structures that map keys to values, and are backed by a real array in memory, with some form of collision handling for values that hash to the same location.
- trees - data structures that consist of nodes with optional data elements and one or more child pointers/references, and possibly parent pointers, representing a heirarchical or ordered set of data elements.
- graphs - data structures that represent arbitrary relationships between members of any data set, represented as networks of nodes and edges.

Candidates should be able to describe, for any of the data structures above:

- what you use them for (real-life examples)
- why you prefer them for those examples
- the operations they typically provide (e.g. insert, delete, find)
- the big-O performance of those operations (e.g. logarithmic, exponential)
- how you traverse them to visit all their elements, and what order they're visited in
- at least one typical implementation for the data structure

Some of these may be duplication(TODO - Edit), goal - be able to quickly answer the following questions below:

- Explain quickly and concisely the significant projects I have worked on
- What have I failed in - what did I learn?
- What am I proud of accomplishing - explain why.
- What am I looking for in a new opportunity?
- Where am I interested in going careerwise in the next couple of years?
- My top questions for a prospective employer
