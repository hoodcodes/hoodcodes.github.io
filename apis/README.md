### Making money from APIs you create

If you have an idea for an API that others would benefit from, you can create it, host it, and then market it over at [RapidAPI.com](https://rapidapi.com). The process to setup your account and add your first API to the marketplace is quick and easy.

### Documenting APIs / HATEOS

I do not think API documentation should be necessary in most cases - but this course below seems to talk about this: (using HATEOAS - APIs should have everything you need inside them)

**HATEOAS Principle**

- Hypermedia as the engine of application state
- provide the information needed to interact with the server
- states that every response from the server to a client includes the information needed to interact with all other resources available on the server
