# Free Code Camp Go Course Notes

There is a very good 7+ hour course(2019) on Go by Beau Carnes with FreeCodeCamp.org:

- [Golang in 7 hours (No Ads)](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/go-golang-course/)
- [YouTube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS4e4q9oBaU)

These are my notes from going through the course.
