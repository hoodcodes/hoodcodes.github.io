# Books on Programming

### Overview

At one time I have maybe 50-75 books. But I gave them all away under the illusion that I could be happy just with digital books. I was wrong. So I am building my library of books back up. I now find having actual books of more value than I previously thought.

As I go through each book, or refer to specific sections, I would like to capture concise thoughts to keep as reference notes. I will have a separate page for each book. Also, I would like to keep a list of other books of interest.

### My Library

- [Ace The Programming Interview - 160 Questions and Answers for Success]()
- [Introduction to Algorithms]()
- [Design Patterns]()
- [Head First Design Patterns]()
- [Specification By Example]()
- [Refactoring]()
- [Refactoring to Patterns]()
- [Clean Architecture]()
- [97 Things Every Programmer Should Know]()
- [Joe Celko's SQL for Smarties]()
- [Dependency Injection]()
- [Timeless Laws of Software Development]()

**E-Books**

- [The Imposter' Handbook - Rob Conery]()
