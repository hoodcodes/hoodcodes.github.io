# Books on Programming

[psst... Here are some other books (non-technical) I have made notes for]()

### Overview

I am building my library of books back up, after having tried going fully digital in the past. I now find having actual books of more value than I previously thought.

As I go through each book, or refer to specific sections, I would like to capture concise thoughts to keep as reference notes. I will have a separate page for each book. Also, I would like to keep a list of other books of interest.
