# Books on Programming

### Overview

At one time I have maybe 50-75 books. But I gave them all away under the illusion that I could be happy just with digital books. I was wrong. So I am building my library of books back up. I now find having actual books of more value than I previously thought.

As I go through each book, or refer to specific sections, I would like to capture concise thoughts to keep as reference notes. I will have a separate page for each book. Also, I would like to keep a list of other books of interest.
