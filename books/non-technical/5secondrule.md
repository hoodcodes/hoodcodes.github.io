5 Second Rule - Book Notes - Mel Robbins -

Right before you do something that makes you nervous - say “I’m excited”. It will relax the brain

use the 5-4-3-2-1

Give yourself an anchor thought - something positive.

so - you can trick your mind

it is simple to change. Really. Remember it is YOUR job to push yourself

you will struggle with self-doubt.

Don’t hesitate. do something

don’t put the phone in your bedroom. Random rewards is what we are hooked to so we look at stuff.

how you wake up, not when you make up - that matters

the spotlight effect - the more

how can you possibly climb out of a hole when you are beating yourself down?

change is simple - but not easy.

the smallest things can feel so hard. pretty universal - staying positive, making a decision, making time for yourself, raising your hand, speaking up, making plans, talking to someone you find attractive, saying no, eating in moderation, just getting up on time.

habit loop - coded in your brain.

she didn’t want to destroy her marriage, didn’t want to feel like the world’s worst mom, she wanted to be financially secure, happy, proud of herself again. desperately wanted to change - just didn’t know how. wanted to improve her life - didn’t know how to do that either.

the pic of the rocket launch changed her - a tipping point.

your body is trying to send you signals all day long - your brain your body - - instinct - so when you learn to start paying attention to your instincts and then honor them with deliberate action - it changes your life. there is research from UA/Cornell/Duke - to confirm a powerful connection between your brain and and yoour instinct to change your life your brain fires up your instincts to take action . your brain creates a list of what to do

some of the greatest achievements have come about from instincts that were acted upon. match, velcro, postit note, frappichino,

you got to bet on yourself

ignored how she felt, she did the 5 second rule.

you have to act - move - or you won’t

Motivation is Garbage

use the rule to FORCE yourself to take simple steps, to move forward. to create momentum.

push yourself out of your thoughts and into action.

locus of control - the more you believe that you are in control of your life, your actions, and your future - the more happier and successful you are going to become.

the Power of a Push!

Bias toward Action - you become the type of person that stops thinking about everything and starts taking action.

if you are a person that tends to overthink everything - you are about to discover the energy and the confident to start moving.

this ‘tool’ doesn’t make things easy - but it makes them happen

a moment of hestitation is a kiss of death. fear, self-doubt, can take over and make the smallest excuses. its okay to hestiate on the BIG things. But it is the little things that we need to stop hesitating to act upon.

after all it is the little things in life that define you.

bad habits include overthinkng, worrying, hesitating, thinking, doubting, analyzing.

But you can use science to overcome them. you are not a worrier - you have a habit of worrying…

every phase of your life and career will require a different ‘you’ - who are you needed to be right now?

--------- Chapter 6

“What do i want to eat?” - what are you actually saying? “What do I feel like eating”

“Should I get up?” subconsciously we are asking “Do I feel like getting up?”

logically you know what you should be doing, but its your feelings about it that make your decisions for you. Your feelings will make the decision for you before you even realized what happened. And how you feel in the moment - not aligned with your goals.

if you only act when you feel like it - you will never get what you want. EVER.

if you don’t feel like going for a run - you won’t. if you don’t feel like attacking your to do list, you won’t. but 5-4-3-2-1 - you can activate your prefrontal cortex and force yourself to do it.

you have to learn how to untangle your feelings from your actions, or you will never unlock your true potential.

here’s how feelings keep you from changing:
weigh the pros and cons
stop moving towards your goal
consider how you feel about what you are about to do.  
hesitate

you are not battling X, you are battling your FEELINGS about doing it. you are more than capable of doing it - to change anything, despite how you feel.

You cannot control how you feel, but you can always choose HOW you act.

Feelings are suggestions. Athletes ignore that.

Our minds are not stupid. They are designed to protect us from pain. That’s why we have to NUDGE ourselves

you have to PUSH through the destructive thoughts
