### Banker's Rounding

math.round(6.5) = 6 while math.round(9.5) = 10. why?

That's called rounding to even (or banker's rounding), which is a valid rounding strategy for minimizing accrued errors in sums (MidpointRounding.ToEven). The theory is that, if you always round a 0.5 number in the same direction, the errors will accrue faster (round-to-even is supposed to minimize that) (a).

Languages that use Bankers' rounding include Intel processors, C#, Python and R, but not Java, C/C++, JavaScript, PHP, Go, Rust or Swift.
