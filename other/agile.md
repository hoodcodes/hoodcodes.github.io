# Agile Reference

**Agile Marketing Manifesto**
empiricism the theory that all knowledge is derived from sense-experience. Stimulated by the rise of experimental science, it developed in the 17th and 18th centuries, expounded in particular by John Locke, George Berkeley, and David Hume.

"The Heart of Agile": Build > Measure > Learn

**product owner** - The Product Owner is the sole person responsible for managing the Product Backlog. - understanding the customers need - effectively manage the PBacklog - proxy the org to the dev team, enabling focus - be available to the scrum team throughout each sprint
(product owner is in charge of "what", development team is in charge of "how")

**scrum master** - manager of the scrum, not people - ensures scrum is understood and enacted - faciliattes (scrum) events as needed - removes impediments to the teams success throughout each
sprint - coaches others on how to work with the scrum team in an iterative, incremental environment - Embodies agility and empiricism
\*\* strives to help the scrum team become self-managing with scrum

**Development team** - deliver fully working software at least once per sprint - each working product delivery is an increment - each increment meet the teams Definition of Done - a very small addition to the product may constitute an increment

self organizing - selects work and chooses how to do it - accountavility is shared among (ideally) 3-9 members

Cross functional (an inch deep a lot of things, a mile deep in one thing)

- PO & SM are NOT our admins (personal assistants)
- Backlog Refinement (instead of Backlog Grooming)
- Everything in scrum inspects something, and adapts something.

We can make commitments to new behaviors, we cant make commitments to scope. If you commit to scope you're a liar.

Time driven (date target planning) the product will release on a specific date. Scope is flexible.

Feature driven (scope target planning) The product will release when features A, B, or C are complete. Date is flexible.

Velocity - an empirical observation of the amount of work completed by a team in previous sprints \* this is a lagging indicator
