Color Blindness - https://wearecolorblind.com/

Trello has a color-blind friendly mode: https://wearecolorblind.com/examples/trello-colorblind-friendly-mode/

- Colorblind Friendly mode adds a simple textured overlay to the colored labels everywhere they’re shown.
- The labels keep their color, the textures are added on top of the labels itself.
- The colorblind friendly mode can be turned on or off from the user-settings page or simply when selecting a label. It’s very easy to discover and when enabled does not get in the way of users that aren’t color blind.
