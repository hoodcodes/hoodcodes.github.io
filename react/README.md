### React vs. Angular

[Mosh: React vs. Angular](https://programmingwithmosh.com/react/react-vs-angular/)

- Angular (Google) - is a full fledged MVC framework. You get more out of the box, so you can start coding right away. But you have to use what Angular provides.
- React (Facebook) - is a library, providing the 'view' only in MVC.

Angular provides:

- Templates
- XSS protection
- DI
- Ajax requests by @angular/HTTP
- Routing, provided by @angular/router.
- Component CSS encapsulation
- Utilities for unit-testing components
- @angular/forms for building forms.

React - just a Library - providing the ‘View’ only in MVC. You are responsible for managing everything else, and you have flexibility to use what you want.

This will require more maintenance when you use many independent, fast-moving libraries - you have to take care of corresponding updates and migrations by yourself.

So Angular will look more similar across projects, while with each React project you can have them looking quite unique.

Folder organization and architecture decisions need to be made in each React project.

So things can more easily go wrong in React due to this flexibility.
