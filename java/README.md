# Java Reference From a C# Developer's Perspective

This is an opinionated reference on the Java language, however for clarification, I am not going to be bashing this language. More just pointing out that I am looking at Java from the perspective of a C# developer. My interest is to point out the differences between the two languages, showcase strengths and limitations of Java, and provide context and/or background on topics that are interesting to me.
