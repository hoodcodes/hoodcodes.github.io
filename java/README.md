### Summary Description

### Coming from a C# Developer's Perspective

This is an likely to be a somewhat opinionated reference on the Java language, however for clarification, I have no desire to bash any technology, let alone this language. I must admit I have heard more negative comments about Java than positive, but I am looking to find out for myself the strengths of the language, the finer points, and then understand its limitations. Every language has limitations. Would Java be a better language for certain applications over other languages? But I will be transparent and point out that I am looking at Java from the perspective of a C# developer. My interest is to point out the differences between the two languages, showcase strengths and limitations of Java, and provide context and/or background on topics that are interesting to me.
